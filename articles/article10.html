    <h2>Cal Ice Hockey Gearing up for the Crown Jewel of the Season Schedule</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">
        After a road trip that included travel woes and four back-to-back games, the UC Berkeley hockey team will
        return home for an event that all Cal fans circle on their calendar, the Big Freeze.
    </p>
    <p>
        This year’s Big Freeze will feature a white-out theme, a special guest puck drop, the Cal Band and Oski the
        Bear.
    </p>
    <p>
        “The Big Freeze is more than a hockey game—it’s a celebration of resilience, rivalry, and community.” Cal Ice
        Hockey General Manager Michele Cox said. “For Cal Ice Hockey, it’s the pinnacle of our season; for UC
        Berkeley, it’s a unifying tradition that brings students, alumni, and fans together; and for the Bay Area, it’s proof
        that hockey belongs here as much as innovation and culture do. This game freezes time for one night, reminding
        us all why sport matters.”
    </p>
    <p>
        UC Berkeley’s 12th Chancellor, Rich Lyons, will drop the ceremonial first puck for the Big Freeze on Saturday
        at 7 p.m., one week before the kickoff of the “Big Game” between Cal and Stanford football on November 22.
    </p>
    <p>
        Cal typically hosts the Stanford Cardinal in the Big Freeze as a precursor to the Big Game. Stanford has opted
        out of the Big Freeze this season. Loyola Marymount University will take Stanford’s place and will provide a
        familiar look on the ice, wearing a crimson red and white jersey akin to Stanford’s cardinal red and white.
    </p>
    <p>
        "The Big Freeze is Cal Ice Hockey's most exciting event of the year,” head coach Devin Cox said. “and one of
        the most unique spectacles that Cal supporters can attend. While having Stanford as the opponent is
        traditionally a major drawing factor — it is truly the way the fans show up and the players get energized that
        makes the Big Freeze as special as it is.”
    </p>
    <p>
        The Golden Bears will enter the weekend matchup on a 10-game win streak and a 13-1 overall record. The team
        is coming off a four-game road trip last weekend that included a 16-hour travel day because of the government
        shutdown. Despite the delays, Cal defeated the University of Washington in two games and Western
        Washington University in two games. After the trip, Cal ranked 5th in ACHA's first western rankings out of almost 200 teams.
    </p>
    <p>
        “From a packed crowd to a roaring Cal Band, with important symbols of UC Berkeley walking around like Oski
        and the Chancellor, it’s an excellent reminder that our hockey team is far more than just a club organization.
        We’re looking forward to showcasing just how exhilarating Cal Ice Hockey games can be,” Devin Cox said.
    </p>
    <p>
        The LMU Lions have a 7-6 record and take on the San Jose State Spartans on Friday before two games against
        Cal at the Oakland Ice Center.
    </p>
    <p>
        "The Big Freeze is the Cal Bears Ice hockey team's Superbowl.” Assistant coach Mark Arneson said. “The Big
        Freeze is Cal's most fun hockey event of the year. Bring on the Cal band, Oski, and fill the stands to capacity.
        Let us celebrate the tradition of the Big Freeze for many more years to come."
    </p>
    <p>
        All fans are encouraged to wear white and arrive early. Both teams will take the ice at 7 p.m. The game will also be broadcast live on Black Dog Hockey.
