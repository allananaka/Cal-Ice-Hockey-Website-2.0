        <h2>UC Berkeley Hockey Clinches the Top Seed in the PAC-8</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
            The California Golden Bears hockey team swept its opponents over Veteran’s Day weekend to improve to a
16-0 overall record, 14-0 in conference. The weekend included two games against Eastern Washington
University and two games against Washington State University - all games took place at the EWU student
recreation center in Cheney, Wash.
        </p>
        <p>
            A few weeks prior, Cal narrowly extended its win streak against the University of Washington. With 6.1 seconds
remaining in regulation and the game tied 1-1, Berkeley forward Patrick Liu scored on a one-timer shot off a
pass from forward Kodai Mizuno. The goal stood as the game winner to lift the Golden Bears to a 10-0 start to
the season.
        </p>
        <p>
            The winning continued the following weekend when Cal defeated the Western Washington Vikings in two
shutout victories. Freshman goalie Aidan Comeau earned his third shutout of the season in a 6-0 victory and
senior goalie Yusef Akbas earned his first shutout of the year in a 10-0 win.
The Golden Bears collected four more wins over the holiday weekend. Comeau earned his fourth shutout of
the season and improved to an 11-0 record in goal. Berkeley clinched the top spot in the Pacific 8
Intercollegiate Hockey Conference (PAC-8) with its wins over the holiday weekend. This season’s PAC-8
playoffs will take place February 7-9.
        </p>
        <p>
            Comeau has been a trustworthy backstop for the Golden Bears this season - he’s accumulated a save
percentage of 0.961 and a goals against average of 0.82 in conference play.
        </p>
        <p>
            Cal will return home this Friday for what is always the most anticipated contest of the season - The Big Freeze
versus Stanford. The Big Freeze is a battle that has taken place since the early 1900’s between Cal and its
rival from across the Bay. The Cal Band will be in attendance to contribute to the best college hockey
atmosphere in the Bay Area.
        </p>
        <p>
            Berkeley will host California State University, Northridge for two games following the Big Freeze to conclude its
home schedule for the fall.
