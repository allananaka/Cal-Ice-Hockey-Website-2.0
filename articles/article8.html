        <h2>Cal Ice Battles Through Adversity at PAC-8 Playoffs, Earns Spot in ACHA Regionals</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
            The Cal Ice team returned earlier this week from the PAC-8 Playoffs in Cheney, Washington, following a hard-fought postseason run. At the PAC-8 Awards Banquet on February 7th, Head Coach Devin Cox was honored as Coach of the Year, while standout players Aidan Comeau (#80, Goalie), Kodai Mizuno (#9, Forward), and Sean Dolim (#88, Defense) earned First-Team All PAC-8 honors. Additionally, Comeau and Mizuno were named to the All PAC-8 Rookie Team, highlighting their exceptional performances in their debut season.

            Despite battling a team-wide illness that quickly spread upon arrival, Cal opened the tournament with a commanding 7-2 victory over UC San Diego. However, adversity struck again in the following game against USC, as top forward Kodai Mizuno sustained an injury in the first period, forcing him to miss the remainder of the playoffs. In a dramatic semifinal matchup, Cal overcame the setback, securing a 3-2 overtime victory to advance to the championship game.

            Short-handed due to injuries and illness, Cal faced the University of Washington in a tightly contested final. The game remained competitive throughout, with both teams exchanging goals. As the third period wound down, Cal trailed 6-5 and pulled their goalie in the final two minutes in an attempt to force overtime. However, Washington capitalized on an empty-net opportunity, sealing their victory and denying Cal a PAC-8 Championship. The loss was particularly tough, as it ended Cal’s undefeated 25-0 regular season.

            Although they fell short of the PAC-8 title, Cal’s season is far from over. The ACHA Division 2 Regional Tournament invitations have been announced, and Cal secured the 12th seed, earning a shot at redemption in Westminster, Colorado. They will face 9th-seeded University of Texas on Thursday, February 20, at 10:15 AM (MT), with the game streamed live on FloHockey.tv.
