    <h2>Golden Bears Back on the Ice After Winter Break</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">
        The No.8 California Golden Bears hockey team returns to battle this weekend at the Big Mountain Classic in Colorado.
    </p>
    <p>
        Cal will take on the Metropolitan State University of Denver, Dakota College at Bottineau, No. 13 Northeastern University and No. 7 University of Colorado. The invitational spans four days and across multiple venues in Colorado. It will mark the first time the Golden Bears prepare for game action in almost two months.
    </p>
    <p>
        “An invite to high-profile tournaments like the Beehive and Big Mountain Classic signifies respect and acknowledgement of our team's success,” General Manager Michele Cox said.
    </p>
    <p>
        Before the winter break, Cal played four games at the Beehive Showcase in Utah and went 1-3 against four of the top five teams in the American Collegiate Hockey Association’s (ACHA) west division. The one win was a dramatic shootout win against an undefeated Weber State team.
    </p>
    <p>
        The lengthy winter break provided the Golden Bears with an opportunity to recover and gear up for the final stretch of the season.
    </p>
    <p>
        “The team actually enjoyed rest and time away from the rink for the most part,” Head Coach Devin Cox said. “Despite the large roster, we only had a handful of players without some level of injury designation back in December--so getting everyone rested and healthy was a priority for this second-half push towards playoffs.”

    </p>
    <p>
        Cal’s first contest in the Big Mountain Classic is Friday at 7:15 p.m. against MSU Denver in Westminster, CO. All four games over the weekend will serve as an important benchmark for a healthy Cal team gearing up for the postseason.
    </p>
    <p>
        “Playing against elite competition challenges both our team and individual players, fostering growth and preparing us for the intensity of postseason play,” Head Coach Devin Cox said.
    </p>
    <p>
        Live streams will be available for all Big Mountain Classic games at the “Big Mountain Hockey Conference" YouTube page. All MSU Denver games can be found on the “MSU Denver ACHA Hockey” YouTube page.
