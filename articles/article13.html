    <h2>Golden Bears Respond on Senior Night With Statement Win Over USC</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">
        The No. 8 California Golden Bears delivered a strong response on Senior Night, bouncing back from a tough loss to defeat conference rival USC 4–1 on January 24 at the Oakland Ice Center.
    </p>
    <p>
        The weekend series against the Trojans carried added weight for Cal. USC entered the matchup fresh off an upset win over the University of Washington, and after the Golden Bears fell 7–3 on Friday night, Saturday’s game became a pivotal opportunity to reset and respond — especially with the postseason looming.
    </p>
    <p>
        Senior Night added another layer of emotion, as Cal honored its graduating players before puck drop. Playing in front of family, friends, and teammates, the Golden Bears came out with renewed focus and energy, controlling play and setting the tone early.
    </p>
    <p>
        Cal capitalized on its chances offensively while tightening up defensively, limiting USC’s opportunities and getting a composed performance between the pipes. The result was a complete team effort and a 4–1 victory that showcased the group’s resilience and ability to respond under pressure.

    </div>
    <p>
        The win served as an important confidence boost as Cal turns its attention to the final stretch of the regular season. The Golden Bears host San José State University this upcoming Friday in their final tune-up before postseason play begins on February 6.
    </p>
    <p>
        With playoffs approaching, every game continues to serve as preparation for the intensity ahead.
    </p>
    <p>
        Beyond the on-ice results, the Golden Bears continue to emphasize purpose and perspective through their partnership with the Brought to Reality (BTR) Foundation, a nonprofit organization dedicated to mental health awareness and suicide prevention.
    </p>
    <p>
        During the team’s recent Colorado trip, every Cal player proudly wore a BTR sticker on their helmet, symbolizing their commitment to the foundation’s mission. Cal became the 64th team to meet with BTR, joining a growing community of programs spreading the message that there is always another path forward.
    </p>
    <p>
        Founded by parents who lost their son to suicide, BTR works directly with athletes to break the stigma surrounding mental health. The foundation actively helps individuals find appropriate mental health care and will even cover the cost of services for athletes who are unable to afford them.
    </p>
    <p>
        The impact has resonated deeply within the Cal locker room.
