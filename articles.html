                    <p>The 2019-2020 Bears were loaded with offensive talent up and down their lineup. Headlined by forwards Delfino Varela (8G, 14A, 18GP) and Gabriel Giammarco (10G, 10A, 16GP), the Bear’s explosive offense propelled them to a record of 14 Wins and 9 Losses overall. Not to outdone, however, were the Bears defensemen. D-men Matt Chorlian (2G, 7A, 22GP)  and Jefferey Chen (6G, 6A, 24GP) kept Cal’s blue line solid all season long and kept opponents to 2 or fewer goals 11 games this season.</p>
